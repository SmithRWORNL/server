DOECode Services
==================

Introduction
------------

Description of services provided by the API back end of DOECode.  The HTTP `GET` verb is used to retrieve information in various desired formats, and the `POST` verb used to send new and updated metadata information to the persistence back end.

> The API is available via `/doecode/services/` on the DOECode server.

Metadata Service Endpoints
--------------------------

### Retrieve metadata in JSON format
`GET` /services/metadata/{codeId}

Retrieve the metadata by its *{codeId}* value.  Values returned as single JSON Objects.  See [metadata example below](#json_example) for metadata JSON format.
Optionally, you may specify the query path parameter "format=yaml" to retrieve this information in YAML format.  JSON is the default output format.  Only retrieves
PUBLISHED records.

```json 
{ "metadata" : 
  { "software_title" : "Sample Data", "code_id": 234 ... } 
}
```

| Response Code | Information |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | OK, response includes JSON |
| 403 | Access to unpublished metadata is not permitted |

### Retrieve any metadata, authenticated
`GET` /services/metadata/edit/{codeId}

Retrieve JSON for a given metadata.  User must be authenticated and be the owner of the given metadata.

| Response Code | Information |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | OK, JSON returned |
| 400 | Bad request, no code ID specified |
| 401 | Authentication is required for this service endpoint |
| 403 | Logged-in user is not permitted to access this metadata |
| 404 | Metadata CODE ID is not on file |

### Retrieve information from repository API
`GET` /services/metadata/autopopulate?repo={url}

Attempt to read information from the given *repository URL* value.  Supports github.com, bitbucket.org, and sourceforge.com. 
Any relevant information from the repository API will be returned in JSON metadata format.
Mapped repository information varies according to service API-supplied metadata.  Optionally, you may specify
a query parameter of "format=yaml" to receive YAML file suitable for download.

### Save metadata information
`POST` /services/metadata

Send JSON metadata to be persisted in the back-end.  This service persists the data in the *Saved* work-flow state. Returns metadata information in JSON format, if successful, with
*code_id* value for reference.

> Incoming JSON format:
```json
{ "software_title" : "Sample Data", ... }
```
> Successful Response:
```json
{ "metadata" : { "code_id" : 123, "software_title" : "Sample Data", ... } }
```
> Error Response:
```json
{ "status" : 500, "errors" : ["Error saving record for \"Sample Data\": database failure." ] }
```

| Response Code | Information |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Metadata saved, JSON metadata information returned including code_id reference. |
| 401 | Authentication is required to POST |
| 403 | User is not permitted to alter this metadata |
| 500 | Persistence error or unable to parse JSON information. |

### Publish metadata information
`POST` /services/metadata/publish

Send JSON metadata to be persisted in the *Published* work-flow state.  Validation on required metadata fields is performed, and any errors preventing this operation will be returned.  

> Successful Response:
```json
{ "metadata" : { "code_id" : 123, "software_title" : "Sample Data", ... } }
```
> Error Response:
```json
{ "status" : 400, "errors":[ "Title is required", "Developers are required", "Provided email address is invalid", ... ] }
```
